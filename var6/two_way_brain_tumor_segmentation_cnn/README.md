# Two Way CNN for HGG/LGG Brain tumor segmentation

Following the idea of [Havaei et. al.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841516300330) in we have implemented a so called TwoPathways Convolutional network made up by a local and a global path. Both two paths get as input the four modality of a patch 33x33, centered in the pixel that we want to classify, in a slice of a RMI.
